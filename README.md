This repo contains my attempts at Codeup's clustering exercises

- Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. It is a main task of exploratory data analysis and a common technique for statistical data analysis. Clustering is used in many fields, including pattern recognition, image analysis, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning.

- In machine learning, we often group examples as a first step to understand a subject (data set) in a machine learning system. Grouping unlabeled examples is called clustering. [What is Clustering?](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/clustering/overview)

## Centroid-based Clustering
- Centroid-based clustering organizes the data into non-hierarchical clusters, in contrast to hierarchical clustering defined below. k-means is the most widely-used centroid-based clustering algorithm. Centroid-based algorithms are efficient but sensitive to initial conditions and outliers. This course focuses on k-means because it is an efficient, effective, and simple clustering algorithm.

## Density-based Clustering
- Density-based clustering connects areas of high example density into clusters. This allows for arbitrary-shaped distributions as long as dense areas can be connected. These algorithms have difficulty with data of varying densities and high dimensions. Further, by design, these algorithms do not assign outliers to clusters.
