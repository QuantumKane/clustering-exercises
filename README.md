This repo contains my attempts at Codeup's clustering exercises

Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. It is a main task of exploratory data analysis and a common technique for statistical data analysis. Clustering is used in many fields, including pattern recognition, image analysis, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning.

## Centroid-based Clustering

Centroid-based clustering organizes the data into non-hierarchical clusters, in contrast to hierarchical clustering defined below. k-means is the most widely-used centroid-based clustering algorithm. Centroid-based algorithms are efficient but sensitive to initial conditions and outliers. This course focuses on k-means because it is an efficient, effective, and simple clustering algorithm.
